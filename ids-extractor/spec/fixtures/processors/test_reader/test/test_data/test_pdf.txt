HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Donald French is a 53-year-old patient who is admitted with back and chest pain. The patient is
obese. He has hypertension. He has had recurrent episodes of midsternal pain radiating to the left
shoulder and down the left arm. The pain manifests itself as if an “elephant was sitting on his chest.” He
states that he has had this pain for at least a month or possibly longer. He gets it with physical activity
and also during sexual intercourse. The patient was in a stressful family situation, and his blood pressure
went up significantly in October. He took medication, and the medication brought the values down. He
does not know about his cholesterol. He does have gastroesophageal reflux . This has been a chronic
problem. His current pain is different than his reflux pain.

OBJECTIVE
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 138/90, pulse 78, weight 296 pounds.
NECK: Veins are not visibly distended. Carotids are brisk without bruits.
LUNGS: Breath sounds are equal bilaterally without rales, rhonchi or dullness.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Estimated apex impulse not palpable due to body habitus. First and second heart
sounds are normal without murmur, gallop or rub.
ABDOMEN: Protuberant and soft. Organs are not palpable.
EXTREMITIES: Pulses are equal in both arms and in both legs. No edema.
Electrocardiogram: No acute changes.
ASSESSMENT:
1.
Chest pain, rule out coronary atherosclerotic heart disease.
2.
Obesity.
3.
Musculoskeletal low back pain.
4.
Systemic hypertension.
PLAN:
Mr. French has had recurrent chest discomfort. He, at first, made rather light of it, but then after some
discussion, it becomes clear that this has been going on for a couple of months, and it is typically brought
on by physical activity including during sexual intercourse. I think that he has a high risk factor profile
for coronary artery disease in that he is an adult male, obese with hypertension. Due to the recurrence of
his discomfort, cardiac catheterization is indicated. This will be carried out later this afternoon. He has
had a previous catheterization done, he thinks in 1996, which did not reveal disease. The risks and
benefits of cardiac catheterization were explained to the patient which he was aware of since he had a
previous study. The possibility of doing angioplasty with stenting was also discussed with its possible
need for emergent surgery. He understands and agrees to proceed.
